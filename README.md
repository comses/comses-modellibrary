## CoMSES Computational Model Library

The _CoMSES Computational Modeling Library_ is a locus for agent based modelers to archive and share their computational
models. We believe that any computational models referenced in a publication *must* be archived along with the digital
artifacts and documentation needed to replicate the results.

We are an open software initiative supported by the [Center for the Study of Institutional
Diversity](http://csid.asu.edu), the [Center for Social Dynamics and Complexity](http://csdc.asu.edu), and the National
Science Foundation.
